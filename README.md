This is a guided project in my data analytics (Power BI) class with Datafied Academy. <br>
## Problem Statement 
In the dynamic hospitality industry, data-driven decision-making has become an indispensable tool for optimising operations and enhancing customer satisfaction. As a budding data analyst, my task is to leverage Power BI to transform and analyse the dataset containing valuable information about hotel bookings.
## Dataset Overview 
The dataset contains various aspects of hotel bookings collected over 3 years (2018 - 2020), ranging from booking details to guest demographics. Each entry contains essential information like the Average Daily Rate (ADR), number of guests, booking agency, arrival details, room assignments, and more. 
## Project Objective 
The project's objective was to help enhance hotel revenue and customer experience through data-driven insights by analysing the booking records and creating dashboard(s) that provide valuable insights. The dashboard should contain insightful charts, graphs, and tables to convey information effectively, thereby enabling informed decision-making on enhancing hotel revenue and customer experience. 
## Business Questions and Metrics
We defined specific business questions that should be answered. Examples of questions include:
a. Who are the people booking? <br>
b. Which of our customers are canceling their bookings? <br>
c. Where do we have the most bookings? <br>
d. Out of the total bookings, how many were successful and unsuccessful? <br>
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
We also defined metrics and KPIs that will help answer the business questions. Examples include:
a. Total booking <br>
b. Total cancellation/cancellation rate <br>
c. Successful booking: Total booking where the reservation status is checked out. Unsuccessful booking: Total booking where the reservation status is canceled or no show. <br>
